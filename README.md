# Frontend Playground - Join Our Gym

![Design preview for the Join Our Gym landing page with single introductory section](./design/desktopjpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Playground](https://www.frontendplayground.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in PNG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

If you would like the Figma file in order to see sizes etc, it is available to download from the challenge page.

If there are any assents you will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but we recommend using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). We've got more information about deploying your project with Netlify below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host your project for free. We recommend using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. If you'd like to use Vercel, here are some steps to follow to get started:

1. [Sign up to Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup).
2. [Connect your GitHub project to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/), using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
3. Once connected, every time you `git push`, Netlify will create a new deployment and the deployment URL will be shown on your dashboard.

## Sharing your solution

1. Submit it on the platform so that other users will see your solution on the site. You will simply need to click the project name, and provide a link to your GitHub respository along with the link to your deployed app on Netlify and give any feedback you desire!

## Please Share

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
